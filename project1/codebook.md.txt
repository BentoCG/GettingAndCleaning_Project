CODEBOOK
=========
Features on this database were obtained from the accelerometer ('Acc') and gyroscope('Gyro') 
3-axial raw signals. Prefix 't' stands for time domain signals, while 'f' indicates frequency 
domain signals. 'Mag' denotes the magnitude of these XYZ signals according to the Euclidean norm.
Every possible combination of this. The acceleration signal was separated between 'Body' and 'Gravity'.

###This dataset is restricted to the *mean* and *std* of every possible variable combination explained
###above, adding up a total of 66 variables.

## Three-axial Variables
####Signals from all axes are separated in different columns (i.e. There is a 'tBodyAcc-X', tBodyAcc-Y',
####and a 'tBodyAcc-Z' column.
